## Installation

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 22+, Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aliyon-dev/review-track-backend
cd review-track-backend
npm install
```

---

## Docker Instructions

### Local development (DB only)

Spins up a local Postgres container. The API runs locally with hot reload.

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Production (full stack)

Builds and runs the API container. Requires `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `PORT` to be set.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The production image uses a multi-stage build — TypeScript is compiled in the build stage and only the compiled output and production dependencies are included in the final image.

---

## Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Start the local database
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# 2. Copy and configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Set DATABASE_URL to the local Postgres instance (see below)

# 3. Apply migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# 4. Generate the Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# 5. Seed the database
npm run db:seed

# 6. Start the development server
npm run dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.  
Interactive API docs (Scalar) are at `http://localhost:8000/api/docs`.

## Database Design

Four models with soft deletes on `User` and `Application`.

```
User
  id, firstName, lastName, email (unique), passwordHash
  role: APPLICANT | REVIEWER | ADMIN
  createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt

Application
  id, title, description, status
  type, priority, amount, justification   ← optional metadata fields
  submittedAt                             ← set when DRAFT → SUBMITTED
  applicantId (→ User)
  createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt

Review                                    ← reviewer comments
  id, comment, applicationId (→ Application), reviewerId (→ User)
  createdAt, updatedAt

AuditLog                                  ← immutable status change history
  id, applicationId (→ Application), changedBy (→ User)
  fromStatus, toStatus, createdAt
```

Every status transition writes an `AuditLog` row in the same database transaction, so the history is always consistent with the application state.

## Middleware

The request pipeline uses five middleware layers, applied in this order:

### `protect` — JWT authentication
Reads the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, verifies the JWT signature using `JWT_SECRET`, and attaches the decoded payload (`id`, `email`, `role`) to `req.user`. Returns `401` if the header is missing or the token is invalid. All protected routes use this middleware.

### `requireRole` / `requireApplicant` / `requireReviewer`
Checks that `req.user.role` matches one of the permitted roles. Returns `403` if the role is not allowed. Pre-built shorthands (`requireApplicant`, `requireReviewer`) wrap the generic `requireRole` factory. Applied after `protect` on role-restricted routes.

### `validate`
Runs `validationResult` from `express-validator` after a chain of field validators has been attached to a route. If any validator fails it collects all error messages, sets the status to `422`, and forwards a single joined error to the error handler. Used on `POST /login` and any route with a request body schema.

### `notFound`
Catch-all registered after all routes. Sets the status to `404` and forwards an error message containing the requested URL. Ensures unmatched paths return a consistent JSON error rather than an Express default HTML page.

### `errorHandler`
Global Express error handler (four-argument signature). Normalizes the status code — if `res.statusCode` is still `200` when an error reaches this handler it defaults to `500`. Responds with `{ success: false, message }`. In `development` mode it also includes the stack trace.

---

## Workflow Explanation

Applications move through a strict state machine. Invalid transitions are rejected with `422`.

```
DRAFT ──────────────────────────────► SUBMITTED
  ▲                                       │
  │                                       ▼
CHANGES_REQUESTED ◄────────── UNDER_REVIEW ──► APPROVED
                                       │
                                       └──────► REJECTED
```

| From | To | Who |
|------|----|-----|
| DRAFT | SUBMITTED | Applicant (submit) |
| SUBMITTED | UNDER_REVIEW | Reviewer (start-review) |
| SUBMITTED | CHANGES_REQUESTED | Reviewer (return) |
| UNDER_REVIEW | APPROVED | Reviewer |
| UNDER_REVIEW | REJECTED | Reviewer |
| UNDER_REVIEW | CHANGES_REQUESTED | Reviewer (return) |
| CHANGES_REQUESTED | DRAFT | Applicant (edit unlocks draft) |

### How transitions are enforced

The allowed moves are declared as a single lookup table in `src/services/workflow.ts`:

```ts
const transitions: Record<ApplicationStatus, ApplicationStatus[]> = {
  DRAFT:              [SUBMITTED],
  SUBMITTED:          [UNDER_REVIEW, CHANGES_REQUESTED],
  CHANGES_REQUESTED:  [DRAFT, SUBMITTED],
  UNDER_REVIEW:       [APPROVED, REJECTED, CHANGES_REQUESTED, DRAFT],
  APPROVED:           [],
  REJECTED:           [],
};
```

`canTransition(fromStatus, toStatus)` does a single array-inclusion check against this table. Both `applicationController.ts` (applicant-facing actions) and `reviewerController.ts` (reviewer-facing actions) call it before delegating to the service layer. If the check fails the controller returns `422` immediately, so the database is never touched.

Once `canTransition` passes, `updateApplicationStatus` in `src/services/applicationService.ts` writes the new status and an `AuditLog` row in a **single Prisma transaction**, guaranteeing the history is always consistent with the current state.

---

## Email Notifications

Status change emails are sent via **Nodemailer** (`src/services/notificationService.ts`). Notifications are fire-and-forget — they run after the database transaction commits and never block or fail the API response.

### When emails are sent

An email is sent for four status transitions:

| Status | Subject |
|--------|---------|
| `UNDER_REVIEW` | Your application is under review |
| `APPROVED` | Your application has been approved |
| `REJECTED` | Your application has been rejected |
| `CHANGES_REQUESTED` | Changes requested on your application |

`DRAFT` and `SUBMITTED` transitions do not trigger an email.

### Template

HTML templates are built in `src/utils/emailTemplates.ts`. `buildStatusEmail(firstName, applicationTitle, status)` returns both an `html` body and a plain-text `text` fallback. The HTML uses a table-based layout with inline styles for broad email client compatibility. Each status is represented by a colored badge pill:

| Status | Color |
|--------|-------|
| UNDER_REVIEW | Green |
| APPROVED | Green |
| REJECTED | Red |
| CHANGES_REQUESTED | Warm brown |

User-supplied content (application title) is HTML-escaped before interpolation to prevent injection.

### Configuration

Set the four SMTP variables in `.env`. Emails are silently skipped when `SMTP_USER` is not set, so the service works in development without any mail configuration.

For Gmail, generate an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) (requires 2-step verification) and use it as `SMTP_PASS`.

## Trade-offs

**Stateless JWT with no token blacklist** — logout is client-side only. A proper server-side logout would require a token blocklist (Redis or a DB table). Not implemented to keep the infrastructure simple; the short token expiry (`JWT_EXPIRES_IN`) mitigates the risk.

**Soft deletes on Application** — deleted records remain in the database. This simplifies audit trail consistency and avoids cascading foreign key issues, but requires all queries to filter `deletedAt IS NULL` if that becomes a concern at scale.

**Single `Review` model for comments** — the schema uses `Review` for reviewer comments rather than a separate `Comment` model. This is sufficient for the current workflow but conflates structured feedback with freeform comments.

**`type` and `priority` as plain strings** — kept flexible to avoid premature enum constraints while the product design finalises the exact values. Should be migrated to enums once values are stable.

**No pagination** — `GET /api/applications` returns all records. Acceptable for a small dataset; needs cursor or offset pagination before scaling.

**422 over 403 for invalid state transitions** — the requirements spec suggested 403 (Forbidden) when a transition is not permitted (e.g. `DRAFT → APPROVED`). 422 (Unprocessable Entity) is more accurate: the request is authenticated and authorized — the problem is that the business logic cannot honour it. 403 implies a permission failure, which would mislead clients into thinking they lack access rather than that the payload is semantically invalid.

## AI Usage

This project was built with AI assistance (Claude) throughout:


- **OpenAPI documentation** — Scalar docs generated alongside each endpoint
- **Test fixes** — identifying and resolving a pre-existing JWT secret mismatch in the test environment
- **Schema evolution** — planning and writing Prisma migrations for new fields

All generated code was reviewed and the architectural decisions (state machine design, soft deletes, audit logging strategy) were made by the developer.

## Future Improvements

- **Pagination** on list endpoints (cursor-based)
- **Token blacklist** for real server-side logout
- **File attachments** on applications (S3/object storage)
- **Admin endpoints** — user management, bulk actions, reporting
- **Rate limiting** on auth endpoints
- **`type` and `priority` enums** once design values are finalised
- **Refresh tokens** to extend sessions without re-login
